            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p class="a">
                    My name is Sean Gammage. I was born in St. Louis, Missouri. I have three older brothers: Cary, Greg, and Brandon. The town I 
                    grew up in is St. Louis. After high school I lived in Port Huron, Michigan for two years playing hockey. After this time, I 
                    game to Stevens Point, Wisconsin to school and play hockey at the University. The high school I attended in St. Louis was
                    Christian Brothers High School and I graduated from their in 2009.

            <!----------------------------- Questions ----------------------------->
            <h3>Why I selected CIS/WDMD as my career choice?</h3>
            	<p class="a">
                	I went through many different elective classes through high school. All of the computer and website design classes I took were
                    the classes that appealed to me the most. So I kind of had it figured out then that this was going to be my career choice. But, I
                    also realized that the job market is very high for this career so that is what put the icing on the cake.
                </p>
                
            <h3>What are my education goals?</h3>
            	<p class="a">
                	Obviously I plan to graduate from the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point with a degree in CIS and a minor in WDMD. I have about
                    two years left to accomplish this.
                </p>
                
            <h3>What are my career goals?</h3>
            	<p class="a">
                	I am really not exactly sure what career I will have yet since I still have two years left of school, but once I get to my career, my
                    goals will be to be very successful at what I'm doing.
                </p>
                
             <h3>Why I am a perfect fit for my career?</h3>
             	<p class="a">
                	I am a perfect fit because I know I will be very good at my career in the future. Excelling in what I do has seemed to follow me my
                    entire life so I would expect that to continue.

                	<p class="bio2">
                    	&nbsp; My name is Sean Gammage. I can be discribed to many people as a fun, talented, happy, and very hardworking person. Currently I am
                        in college at the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point. I plan on graduating  in two years and starting my career in CIS/WDMD. 
                        What brought me to Stevens Point is the part of me that most of my life has been dedicated to and that is hockey! I started playing
                        hockey at the age of two and my whole life since then has revolved around it. I have several awards and trophies to show my progress 
                        in the sport including three high school state championships and a national championship! Though I love hockey more than anything, I
                        realize right now the school is the most important. I have plans for professional hockey after college but school is my main focus
                        right now. In high school I really did not try hard in school as I was too focused in hockey, but my efforts have changed
                        significantly upon coming to college.

                	<p class="bio2">
                    	&nbsp; Life is a great thing. I love every part about living. If you were to talk to any of my friends, they would all say that I am an
                        extremely happy guy. No matter what I always seem to find a way to be happy. Having friends to go along with family and life activities
                        is one of the best parts about life. Sometimes I think I may have too many friends, but that's alright because I they are all great
                        people and we have a lot of fun together. They are what makes tough days (like school days) go by very well. I'm normally pretty busy
                        having hockey and weight lifting everyday along with schooling. So a lot of difficulty comes my way, but having friends/family is
                        what makes these days great. I also find it calming to relax a bit and watch some tv/play video games to help the days go by well too.

                	<p class="bio2">
                    	&nbsp; I feel that my future is looking very good right now. I really hate to think too far in the future because I'm more of a
                        "live in the now" kind of guy. I feel the future will set its self if you are living your life right, right now. All I know is that
                        I will be happy in the future. I could have a career in hockey or I could be doing my career in CIS/WDMD. I do plan on getting
                        married someday and having kids as well. Other than that, the future will have to wait.

                    	&nbsp; So I'm a fun/happy guy. I love hockey. I'm set on having a happy/good life. Strong efforts are very important to me. I am very 
                        content with my life and know that my future will be great. To sum me all up, I'm just another guy in this world living life the
                        best way that he can!
